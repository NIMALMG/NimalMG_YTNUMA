📱 YouTube Mobile – Mindful Watching Concept
By Nimal M G

📖 Problem Statement:
Redesign YouTube’s mobile viewing experience to discourage compulsive binge-watching, without negatively affecting engagement or retention. The solution should subtly influence user behavior using only interface design.

💡 Idea Overview:
I designed a Traffic Light Timer System inside the YouTube mobile app to gently notify users about their continuous screen time and suggest short breaks without forcing them to leave the app.

🎨 Key Features:
1️⃣ Traffic Light Indicator
A small traffic light icon placed on the video player screen.

Green light: Normal watching session.

Orange light: After 3-4 continuous videos, reminding the user they’ve been watching for a while.

Red light: After 6+ videos, subtly warning it might be time for a break.

2️⃣ Break Suggestion Popup
When the light turns red, a friendly, non-intrusive popup appears.

Message: “You’ve been watching for a while! Take a quick break with this 1-minute game or stretch video!”

Two options:

Skip

Play Game

3️⃣ 1-Minute Relax Video Tile
In the home video feed, a special 1-Minute Relax Video tile appears after every few videos, encouraging a quick refresh without leaving the app.

✨ Why This Works:
Uses a universal concept (traffic light) to subconsciously nudge users.

Keeps users engaged through optional mini games or short relaxing videos.

Does not force breaks — it’s user-friendly and choice-based.

Simple UI tweaks without backend changes.

🚀 Conclusion:
This concept promotes mindful watching while protecting dopamine-driven engagement. It improves the overall experience with clear, relatable cues and optional interactive breaks.
